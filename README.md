<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 16px;">here im giving best roadmap for learning the DSA (data-structure-algorithms)</p>

## Programming fundamentals:
* variables, data types, and operators
* control flow (loops, conditionals)
* function and modular programming
* input/output and file handling

## Basic Data Structures:
* Arrays and dynamic arrays
* Linked lists (singly linked, doubly linked)
* Stacks and queues (array-based, linked list-based)
* Hash tables (hash functions, collision handling)

## Basic Algorithms:
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search
3. Bubble Search
4. Insertion Sort
5. Selection Sort

## Advanced Data Structure:
* Trees (Binary trees, Binary search trees)
* Balanced trees (AVL trees, red-black trees)
* Heaps (binary heap, priority queue)
* Graph (Representation, traversal)

## Advanced Algorithms:
* Divide and conquer (Merge sort, quick-sort)
* Dynamic programming (Fibonacci-sequence, knapsack problem)
* Graph Algorithms (breadth-first search, depth-first search)
* Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm)

## Problem Solving Practices:
* Solving coding problems (GFG, Hackerrank, Leetcode, etc)
* Algorithm complexity Analysis (time, space complexity)
* Problem-solving techniques (logical reasoning, algorithmic design)

## Algorithm Techniques:
1. Recursive and backtracking
2. Greedy Algorithms
3. Sliding window technique
4. Two-pointer technique
5. Divide and conquer strategies

## Practice Projects:
* Implementing data structures and algorithms in practical projects
* Solving real-world problems using algorithms
* Optimizing algorithms for efficiency and performance

## Continuous Learning...!
* Reading E-books etc
* Exploring research papers and online resources etc

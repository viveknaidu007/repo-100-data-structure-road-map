# repo-100-data-structure-road-map
here im giving best roadmap for learning the DSA (data-structure-algorithms)

## Programming fundamentals:
* variables , data types, and operators
* control flow (loops , conditionals)
* function and modular programming 
* input/output and file handling

# Basic Data Structures:
* Arrays and dynamic arrays
* Linked lists (singly linked , doubly linked)
* Stacks and queues (array-based, linked list-based)
* Hash tables (hash functions , collision handling)

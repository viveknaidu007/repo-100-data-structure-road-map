# repo-100-data-structure-road-map
here im giving best roadmap for learning the DSA (data-structure-algorithms)

## Programming fundamentals:
* variables , data types, and operators
* control flow (loops , conditionals)
* function and modular programming 
* input/output and file handling

# Basic Data Structures:
* Arrays and dynamic arrays
* Linked lists (singly linked , doubly linked)
* Stacks and queues (array-based, linked list-based)
* Hash tables (hash functions , collision handling)

# Basic Algorithms:
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search
3. Bubble Search
4. Insertion Sort
5. Selection Sort

## Advanced Data structure:
* Trees (Binary trees, Binary search trees)
* Balanced trees ( AVL trees, red-black trees)
* Heaps (binary heap, priority queue)
* Graph (Representation , traversal)

## Advanced Algorithms:
* Divide and conquer (Merge sort , quick-sort)
* Dynamic pogramming (Fibonacci-sequence, knapsack problem)
* Graph Algorithms (breadth-first search,depth-first search)
* shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm)

## Problem solving Practices:
* solving coding problems ( GFG , Hackerrank , Leetcode, etc)
* Algorithm complexity Analysis (time , space complexity)
* problem-solving-techniques (logical reasoning , algorithmic design)

## Algorithm Techniques :
1. Recursive and backtrcking:
2. Greedy Algorithms
3. Sliding window technique
4. Two-pointer-technique
5. Divide and conquer strategies

## Practise Projects:
* Implementing data structures and algorithms in pratical projects
* solving real world problems using algorithms
* Optimizing algorithms to effciency and performance

## Continuess Learning....!
* Reading E-books etc
* Exploring research papers and online resources etc ..
